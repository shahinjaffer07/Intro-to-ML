Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored
##AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

##EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

##ALGORITHM:
Gather data consisting of two variables. Input- a factor that affects the marks and Output - the marks scored by students
Plot the data points on a graph where x-axis represents the input variable and y-axis represents the marks scored
Define and initialize the parameters for regression model: slope controls the steepness and intercept represents where the line crsses the y-axis
Use the linear equation to predict marks based on the input Predicted Marks = m.(hours studied) + b
for each data point calculate the difference between the actual and predicted marks
Adjust the values of m and b to reduce the overall error. The gradient descent algorithm helps update these parameters based on the calculated error
Once the model parameters are optimized, use the final equation to predict marks for any new input data
##PROGRAM:
Program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.
